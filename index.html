Welcome to my website! This is my first time creating my own website.
I am a sophomore in the UMaine Business department. Last year I attended Endicott College
which is located in Beverly, Mass. I transferred here this fall and love being a black bear.
I am from Augusta, Maine. On this website you will find information pertaining to myself.
